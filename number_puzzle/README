Number puzzle
-------------

"I can't make this [http://www.camdug.com/events/43816292/], but I did hear a
fun puzzle. It involves converting numbers to words - but for simplicity
missing out spaces, commas, hyphens and "and", so e.g. 172904 becomes
"onehundredseventytwothousandninehundredfour". One can imagine doing this for
numbers up to (but not including) 1 trillion, sorting them alphabetically, and
concatenating them. If you wanted to know what, say, the millionth character of
the resulting string was, how would you find it?"

The answer I got (for the millionth letter of the sequence) was 'e' - this
being the sixty-seventh letter of
"eightbillioneighteenmillioneighthundredeleventhousandsevenhundredseventyeight"
(in case you were wondering).
